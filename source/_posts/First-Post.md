After working as a developer for over three years now (I started my current job in Nov 2013), for at least half of that time or more I have been intending to set up my own website/blog and today I have finally got round to it... wahey - go me!

Like most developers who run their own website and blog, I want to use this website as a place to share what I learn on my coding journey. Perhaps, more importantly, the website will also serve as a reminder for me when I forget how to do something I have once done before!

I have set up the website using a static site generator named Hexo which you can check out yourself here: https://hexo.io. The Hexo docs are great and the general process of getting a basic site up and running is painless as working with the CLI to build the site was intuitive, so it definitely has my approval.

If you're passing through and read up to here thanks for stopping by. Hope to post again soon!
